This is my journal of the design and building process of **Nuclear Fusor**.

## 10/11/2025 8 AM - Research and Making it Low-Cost  

The goal of this project is not to make an expensive fusor; it's to find alternative ways to achieve fusion using techniques like 3d printing and making a lot of the parts custom. The main parts of a fusor include:

-Vacuum Chamber
-Cathode
-Anode
-High Voltage Power Supply
-Vacuum Pump System
-Feedthroughs
-Control/Power
-Monitoring
-Cooling

All of these parts can cost thousands of dollars, but I've found ways to get around this.
For instance, a vacuum chamber with electrical feedthrough can cost around $100. I can create this myself using a glass jar, vacuum pump adapter, and a spot for electrical feedthrough to the anode.

The electrodes are generally pretty cheap. I should be able to use cheap tungsten wire for this. As for the high voltage power supply, a custom ZVS driver with a self-wound flyback transformer fed into a voltage multiplier should be able to create a high enough voltage for this. I will need to insulate accordingly with parafin wax.

The vacuum pump system is the main part that cannot be DIY'd. The high vacuum needed is not possible to make custom so I must budget for that. I need a 2 stage rotary pump which can cost ~$100, but I may be able to make some tweaks to use a single stage pump which can cost ~$50.

For control, power, monitoring, and cooling, I can use standard components. Switches, knobs, buttons, transformers, regular power supplies, LCD screens, fans, and standard microcontrollers should be able to cut it. I will need to use a cheap geiger counter to monitor ionizing radiation (x-rays) being emitted from the fusor. It shouldn't be too much of a worry but I do need to know how much it is producing for safety reasons.

## 10/11/2025 9 AM - Vacuum Chamber + Pump  

I will use a glass dome as the vacuum chamber. This should hold up well.
https://www.amazon.com/ZEERSHEE-Display-Cloche-Wooden-Decoration/dp/B0DMVLJSPG/ ($15)

It is quite cheap. However, it uses a wooden base which cannot hold a vacuum. I'll need to use my school's CNC router (or the one i'm working on if i finish it in time) to mill a custom base out of aluminum. 

https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Aluminum-Thickness-Square-Industrial/dp/B0D9S1TMGS/ ($13)

Then the vacuum pump adapter https://www.amazon.com/Aupoko-Coupler-Adapter-Connector-Manifold/dp/B07T1QZ1NG/ $10

And finally the pressure gauge (https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Pressure-Stainless-Conditioning-Manifolds/dp/B0BCYMT1RT/) $10

This puts the entire chamber at a price of ~$48 which is great considering all the features it has.

As for the vacuum pump and hose, I'll be going with a single stage vacuum pump. Now, it doesn't make high enough of a vacuum so I'll be compensating with a higher voltage applied. It is luckily a lot cheaper to create a higher voltage power supply than a higher vacuum.

This single stage vacuum pump is the cheapest available. (https://www.amazon.com/VIVOHOME-Single-Rotary-Vacuum-Bottle/dp/B07RGQ786R) ($60)

Hose (https://www.amazon.com/Ez-Flo-98617-Clear-Vinyl-Tubing/dp/B07PY4KM8C/) - $6

This puts the most expensive part of the project (the vacuum system) at a total cost of $114. Over the course of the design process I hopefully can reduce this slightly but I don't think I can get it much lower than this.
