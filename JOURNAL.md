This is my journal of the design and building process of **Nuclear Fusor**.

## 10/11/2025 - Research and Making it Low-Cost  

The goal of this project is not to make an expensive fusor; it's to find alternative ways to achieve fusion using techniques like 3d printing and making a lot of the parts custom. The main parts of a fusor include:

-Vacuum Chamber
-Cathode
-Anode
-High Voltage Power Supply
-Vacuum Pump System
-Feedthroughs
-Control/Power
-Monitoring
-Cooling

All of these parts can cost thousands of dollars, but I've found ways to get around this.
For instance, a vacuum chamber with electrical feedthrough can cost around $100. I can create this myself using a glass jar, vacuum pump adapter, and a spot for electrical feedthrough to the anode.

The electrodes are generally pretty cheap. I should be able to use cheap tungsten wire for this. As for the high voltage power supply, a custom ZVS driver with a self-wound flyback transformer fed into a voltage multiplier should be able to create a high enough voltage for this. I will need to insulate accordingly with parafin wax.

The vacuum pump system is the main part that cannot be DIY'd. The high vacuum needed is not possible to make custom so I must budget for that. I need a 2 stage rotary pump which can cost ~$100, but I may be able to make some tweaks to use a single stage pump which can cost ~$50.

For control, power, monitoring, and cooling, I can use standard components. Switches, knobs, buttons, transformers, regular power supplies, LCD screens, fans, and standard microcontrollers should be able to cut it. I will need to use a cheap geiger counter to monitor ionizing radiation (x-rays) being emitted from the fusor. It shouldn't be too much of a worry but I do need to know how much it is producing for safety reasons.
