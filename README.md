# Nuclear-Fusor
A nuclear fusor that employs high voltage across intricately designed electrodes within a vacuum chamber to achieve deuterium-deuterium fusion and release energy.
It draws less than 180W of power, and utilizes a ZVS driver + a custom wound transformer in order to generate high frequency high voltage alternating current.
This is then fed into a 4 stage cockroft-walton multiplier in order to achieve a DC potential of over 50kV. This is more than enough for nuclear fusion
to occur. The limiting factor is the vacuum setup because it is much more expensive to produce. I can always get through design challenges to get a higher voltage, however,
a higher vacuum is just pure cost. This design will just be using a standard single stage mechanical pump to make a low vacuum.
